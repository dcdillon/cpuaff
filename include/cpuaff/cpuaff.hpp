 * ### Description
 *
 * cpuaff is a C++ library that abstracts CPU affinity settings for multiple
 * platforms.
 *
 * ### Details
 *
 * cpuaff builds up a four part view of every processor on a system.  CPUs are
 * identified by their socket, core, and processing_unit.  Additionally each cpu
 * on the system has a notion of its NUMA node.  This allows a developer to
 * select the CPUs at runtime that achieve the performance goals of his/her
 * application.
 *
 * cpuaff aims to eventually be completely header-only for easy integration into
 * existing systems.  For the time being the Linux implementation is
 * header-only.  Other platforms are implemented using
 * [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/) as an interface to the
 * underlying hardware so executables must link to
 * [hwloc](http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/).
 *
 * ### Rationale
 *
 * Managing the CPU affinity of threads within a process is a powerful tool, but
 * operating system provided interfaces are often difficult to use and hard to
 * understand.  To this end, I have created cpuaff which will give an abstract
 * view of the CPUs on a given machine and an easy to use interface to get/set
 * them within a process.
 *
 * ### Licensing
 *
 * cpuaff is distributed under the
 * [New BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) (or BSD 3-Clause)
 *license.
